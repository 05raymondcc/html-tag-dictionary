	<p>li : This is used to define a item from a list, using this to work with unordered list(ul), ordered list(ol)

	attributes : none
	
	<p>example: <li> thingone </li>

	<p>ol : This is used to order items with a chronological order via numbers, making it super organized!

									</ol>

<p>p : the tag that is used to create paragraphs and you can end them by using "/p"(with "<>")

	
	attributes: none
	
	<p>example: <p> This is a very long paragraph that is used to show the command that I am
	using right now, this sentence should be ending soon because it is getting too long, so 
	I think I will end it here. </p>
	
style : contains the style information for a document, or part of a document

	attributes: none
	
	example: <style>  {

	</style>
	
<p>ul : This is used to order items without a chronological order. The items will have a bold dot before
it instead of numbers making it a more organized list.</p>
